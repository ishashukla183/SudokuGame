# Sudoku Game
---
Sudoku is a popular puzzle that requires you to fill blanks in a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and each of the nine 3Ã—3 sub-grids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. There have been various approaches to solving that, including computational ones. In this project, I have implemented the recursive backtracking algorithm as well as Crook's algorithm.

# Background
---
- The modern Sudoku was most likely designed anonymously by Howard Garns, a 74-year-old retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor from Connersville, Indiana, and first published in 1979 by Dell Magazines as Number Place (the earliest known examples of modern Sudoku). Garns's name was always present on the list of contributors in issues of Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games that included Number Place, and was always absent from issues that did not. He died in 1989 before getting a chance to see his creation as a worldwide phenomenon. Whether or not Garns was familiar with any of the French newspapers listed above is unclear.
